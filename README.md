# filterfeeder
[Link](https://filterfeeder.rivques.hackclub.app/)

A tool for filtering RSS feeds. Use e.g. when a podcast puts previews of paid eposodes in its feed. Filter Feeder will go through your feed and remove any episodes you don't want, leaving you with just the good stuff.
## Use
Find the RSS feed link for your podcast. Go to [filterfeeder.rivques.hackclub.app/](https://filterfeeder.rivques.hackclub.app/). Put the link in the link box and add a term that titles must contain (e.g. "Full Episode") or exclude (e.g. "Preview"). You'll get a new link that can be used in your podcast player in a place like "RSS link" or "Custom feed."
